# About

I'm building a 4 place experimental general aviation aircraft, a Vans RV-10.

## Why?


I moved to Ocean City, MD in pursuit of a job. Quickly found out that there's not a lot of general aviation going on in this area. The FBO at the airport rents out an old 172 for $174! So I quickly decided I would buy a plane. I wanted a cross country IFR cruiser, because my ideal mission is to make it back to civilization occasionally. Turns out that for the amount of money I would have to spend to get a 30 year old aircraft, I could do it for roughly the same cost by building a modern one. So here we are.

## Experience

None. Yeah. It's been fun so far trying to figure out exactly what I even need in terms of space and tools and all that.

I will say I have been to an EAA workshop before I jumped head first into things, so I at least have a basic idea of what building an RV entails and the skills I'll need. It'll be an interesting journey for sure.
