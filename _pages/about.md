###What's the RV-10?

From [Vans Aircraft](www.vansaircraft.com):
>The RV-10 is a true four-person airplane, not just an airplane with four seats. It will carry four FAA standard adults, full fuel and sixty pounds of baggage while remaining at or below max gross weight. The cabin accommodates four full-sized adults. Both front and back seats will hold people 6’4″ tall and provide them with truly comfortable leg and headroom. Pilot seats can be adjusted in the cabin while seated. Composite gull-wing doors let occupants board from both sides.
