# Flush Riveting

![](https://imgur.com/3oo6eY0.jpg)

Up until final assembly of the skin onto the ribs, I've done all of my riveting with my pneumatic squeezer. Which meant, the first time I picked up my 3x riveting gun
was to rivet the middle nose ribs to the skins. This is straight into the deep end for a noob to riveting. Everything else on the vertical stablizer was easier to rivet it turns out than the middle ribs.
Not only did I have to learn what pressures the rivet gun liked (125 psi is way too high btw, you want something like 60 -90), I also couldn't see the bucking bar. 

I had some accidents here and there, drilled out 4 rivets in total during the skin assembly process. However, the worst of it is skin damage because of high pressure to the rivet gun.

Here's the finished assembly of the vertical stabilizer skeleton"

I shot some close ups on these Clecos here, because they were a pain to put in, close quarters and all:

And lastly, this is where I left off, with the skin cleco'd and stretched over the skeleton.
